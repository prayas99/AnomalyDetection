# Anomaly Detection Task

Task: 
Our task is to build a machine learning model to detect the presence of thyroid in a patient. After we have built the model, we'll report the accuracy of the model on both the training and testing data and plot a histogram of the prediction values (which range from 0 to 1) of the training data.

Dataset
The dataset for this task is available at the website - https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_IaU9qPQrObS9p-ThaccEj_6mP9eBYdW
The dataset consists of 7200 instances of training data with 6 features and 1 binary output indicating the presence of thyroid.
